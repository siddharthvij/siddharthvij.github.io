      <description>Unearthing Zombies (with Nirupama Kulkarni, SK Ritadhi, and Katherine Waldock ) [Paper]  Abstract  Zombie lending interferes with efficient credit allocation. Using new supervisory data from India, we examine two reforms targeting zombie credit: a bankruptcy law and a regulatory intervention requiring that lenders recognize bad loans. Zombie recognition after the bankruptcy reform is muted in weakly capitalized and government-owned banks. The subsequent regulatory intervention goes further in forcing the recognition of zombie loans at weakly capitalized banks, but effects remain muted among government-owned banks.</description>
